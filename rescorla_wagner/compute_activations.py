    :param input_file:          the path to a a .json file consisting of two lists of lists, the first containing
                                phonetic cues and the second containing outcome meanings; each list contains as many
                                lists as there are learning events in the input corpus (be them full utterances, single
                                words, or any intermediate representation derived from transcribed Child-directed
                                speech). The first list from the list of cue representations matches the first list from
                                the list of meaning representations, both encoding the two layers of the first learning
                                event in the corpus
    :param alpha:               cue salience. For simplicity, we assume that every cue has the same salience, so
                                changing the value of this parameter does not affect the relative strength of
                                cue-outcome associations but only their absolute magnitude.
    :param beta:                learning rate. Again, we make the simplifying assumption that our simulated learners are
                                equally affected by positive and negative feedback. Changing the beta value can have a
                                significant impact on learning outcome, but 0.1 is a standard choice for this model.
    :param lam:                 maximum amount of association that an outcome can receive from all the cues. It simply
                                acts as a scaling factor, so changing its value has the same effects of changing alpha.
    :param indices:             a list of numbers indicating when to store the matrix of associations to file. The
                                numbers indicate percentages of the input corpus.
    :return weight_matrices:    a Python dictionary mapping numerical indices indicating the percentage of learning
                                trials from the input corpus used to NumPy arrays containing cue-outcome associations
                                computed using the Rescorla-Wagner model of learning: cues are rows and columns are
                                outcomes. If the longitudinal parameter is set to False, the dictionary contains one
                                index, 100, and one NumPy array containing cue-outcome associations estimated over the
                                full corpus. If the longitudinal parameter is set to True, the dictionary contains 10
                                indices and as many NumPy arrays, each estimated on an increasing number of learning
                                trials from the input corpus (10%, 20%, 30% and so on)
